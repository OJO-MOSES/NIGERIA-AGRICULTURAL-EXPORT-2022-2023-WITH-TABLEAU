NIGERIA AGRICULTURAL EXPORT (2022 – 2023)

### Introduction 
  In an increasing modern world, understanding the dynamics of a country’s agricultural export sector is crucial for economic growth and sustainability. This project will look into various aspects of the agricultural export sector, including sales performance, time-series analysis, cost analysis, and geographic distribution.
Finally, I will be comparing the performance of different companies based on units sold and profit generated and identify any underperforming products and companies that need attention.

### Project Overview
This project aims to conduct an analysis of Nigeria’s Agricultural Export Dataset over a specified period (2020 to 2023). The objective is to understand the sales performance, time-series trends, cost structures, geographic distributions, and comparative performances of different products and companies.
The goal is to identify key patterns, outliers and potential areas of improvement that could enhance the efficiency and profitability of the export sector.

### Data Source
The primary data source for this project is an extensive dataset containing information on Nigeria Agricultural Exporting products, companies, destination ports, exporting countries, sales and profit from 2020 to 2023. It can be [Downloaded here](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/19xbglh5LG-ANWNY7H7-y1CjugS7No4aC)

### Tools and Techniques.
For this analysis, I utilized Excel (Power Query Editor) for cleaning and enriching the data, and using Tableau for an interactive and explanatory visualization.

### Data Processing and Cleaning 
As a crucial step in data analysis, I performed few preprocessing steps using Power Query Editor.  These steps encompassed renaming columns for clarity, adding columns to enriched data representation, and creating new calculated fields and parameters in Tableau to facilitate comprehensive analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

### Results

* Sesame is the top-selling product with sales of 76,132 units, closely followed by cocoa with sales of 76.129 units, then Cashew with sales of 70833 unit. These three products are the leading contributors to country’s export sector.
  
* The company with the highest sales revenue:
Agro Export Nigeria Ltd emerged as the company the highest sales revenue even though it is the second company in units of goods sold ranking.
Now this leads to the next question “What factors contributed to Agro Export Nigeria Ltd generating the highest revenue, despite being the company with the second-highest sales volume?”
* What factors contributed to Agro Export Nigeria Ltd generating the highest revenue, despite being the company with the second-highest sales volume?
Agro Export Nigeria Ltd.’s focus on high-margin products and strategic sales approaches contribute to its higher revenue, demonstrating that revenue isn’t solely determined by sales volume.
* How sales vary across different export countries.
Denmark and Italy have the highest sales volumes, closely followed by France. These three countries seem to be leading in terms of product demand. 
* Average revenue per export country:
In terms of revenue generation, Italy leads on average, outperforming other countries. France and Denmark trail closely behind, generating average 1. revenues of 17 million and 16.5 million naira respectively. It’s noteworthy that Sweden, despite its efforts, records the lowest average revenue, amounting to 14.7 million naira.
* Total units sold across export countries:
Denmark and Italy are tied for the top spot in terms of sales volume. Hot on their heels are France and Switzerland, with sales figures of 57 thousand and 54 thousand respectively. On the lower end of the scale, Spain, the Netherlands, and Germany rank lower compared to the leading countries.
* Is there any correlation between the units sold and the profit generated?
There is a strong positive linear correlation between the units sold and the profit generated which implies that as the number of units sold increases so does the profit generated.
* How do sales vary over time and are there seasonal trends?
Sales performance exhibited considerable fluctuations from 2020 to 2023, with an overall trend that slightly leaned towards a decrease.
* Sales over the years
In terms of monthly sales, it’s noteworthy that there was a consistent upward trend in 2020, 2021, and 2023. However, the year 2022 stood out as it exhibited a decrease in monthly sales

#### COST ANALYSIS
* What is the product’s cost of goods sold (COGS) as a percentage of revenue?
Rubber and Cocoa have the highest percentage of total cost of goods sold relative to the total revenue (TCOGSP) at 81.3% and 81.1% respectively. This suggests that a significant portion of the revenue from these products is used to cover the cost of goods sold. It could mean high production costs or lower selling prices for these products.
On the other hand, Cassava has the lowest TCOGSP at 78.2%, which means a smaller portion of its revenue is used to cover the cost of goods sold. This could be due to lower production costs or higher selling prices for Cassava.
The TCOGSP for the remaining products (Sesame, Palm Oil, Ginger, Cashew, and Plantain) ranges from 79% to 80.5%. This suggests a relatively similar cost structure or pricing strategy for these products.
Overall, all products have a TCOGSP of around 80%, indicating that the cost of goods sold constitutes a major portion of the revenue for all these products.
* How does the cost of goods sold (COGS) vary across different products?
The product with the highest Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is Cocoa, with a COGS of approximately 1.93 billion naira. This suggests that Cocoa may be the most resource-intensive product to produce, or it may simply be the product with the highest production volume.
On the other end of the scale, the product with the lowest COGS is Ginger, with a COGS of approximately 1.26 billion naira. This could indicate that Ginger is less costly to produce, or it may be produced in smaller quantities compared to the other products.
The remaining products, including Sesame, Palm Oil, Cashew, Cassava, Plantain, and Rubber, have COGS values ranging from approximately 1.50 to 1.79 billion naira. This suggests a relatively similar cost structure or production volume for these products.

#### GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS
* Which destination ports receive the highest volume of exports?
Lagos, as a major economic hub is the leading destination port in terms of export volume. It has received the highest volume of exports, with a substantial figure of 316 thousand. This not only underscores Lagos’ crucial role in the agricultural export sector but also indicates a potentially vibrant market and robust demand in the region.
This finding suggests that businesses exporting to Lagos have access to a large and potentially diverse market.
* Rank the destination port by the export value:
Lagos has emerged as an important port, leading not only in terms of export volume but also in export value. Following closely behind Lagos are Warri and Port Harcourt. Calabar ranks as the port with the least export volume and value. 
* The top export product for each port:
- Calabar: The top import product is Sesame. 
- Lagos: The top import product is Cashew. 
- Port Harcourt: The top import product is Palm Oil. 
- Warri: The top import product is Rubber.

### PERFORMANCE COMPARISON
* How does each product perform in terms of profit margin?
The products with the highest profit margins are Cassava (21.8%), Sesame (21%), Ginger (21%), Cashew (20.8%). This suggests that these products are potentially the most profitable to sell.
The products with the lesser profit margins are Palm Oil (19.5%), Plantain (19.9%), Rubber (18.7%) and Cocoa (18.9%). These products offer a decent profit margin and could be a good balance between profitability and risk.
* Comparison between the performance of different companies based on units sold and profit generated?
The companies with the highest profits are Agro Export Nigeria Ltd (₦383,051,968.36) and Golden Farms Nigeria Limited (₦371,301,964.09). These companies seem to have the most successful operations in terms of profitability.
The companies with the highest total units sold are Golden Farms Nigeria Limited (60,724 units) and Agro Export Nigeria Ltd (59,944 units). These companies appear to have the highest demand for their products.

### Recommendations
Here are some recommendations for Nigeria's agricultural export stakeholders:
1. The farmers should ensure that crops meet international standards to increase marketability and demand and to invest more on modern farming practices and technologies to increase efficiency and reduce costs.
2. The exportering companies should stay informed about market trends, prices, and demand to adjust strategies accordingly and develop strategic partnership with other stakeholders
3. The Government Agencies should develop a comprehensive agricultural policy that supports agriculture development, trade facilitation, and export promotion and promote agricultural research and development.
4. The under-performing companies should:
* Improve Operations Efficiency
* Enhance Quality Control
* Develop a Stronger Marketing Strategy
* Seek Professional Guidance
